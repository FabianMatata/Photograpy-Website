    <h1>Amazing Photos</h1>
    <p>
        Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and loving. <br>
        What you have caught on film is captured forever. <br>
        It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything.
    </p>

    Always take one more shot, to make sure its nothing but the best! <br>
    Take time to confirm with a friend that its the best.

    Add a caption to the photos to bring out more fun in it. Its the unexpected photo that gets the best caption.
